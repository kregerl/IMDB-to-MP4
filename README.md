# IMDB to MP4
Given an identifier from the IMDB URL, this program will download the movie or all episodes and seasons of the show.

For example the identifier from the Deadpool IMDB url `https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1431045/` is `tt1431045`.

## Usage
Currently this program doesn't have an easy way to use it. I still need to add CLI args but it can be run by manually editing the IMDB variable in `main.rs`.

**This program requires NodeJS**
